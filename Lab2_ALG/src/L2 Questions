3.	Runway Reservation System is an application that handles reservation of landing slot request
    for a single runway airport. The system has the following features:

    •	Reserve request that specifies landing time t.
    •	Add t to a set of landing request R, if no other landings are schedule within 3 minutes.
    •	Remove from set:
        o	Landed plane.
        o	Diverted plane with existing request.
        o	Canceled flight with existing landing reservation.
    •	Search next landing request, given the current request time.
    •	Print out landing request list.

The following are the sequence of request (Initial set R is empty.
Assuming the time is monotonically increasing and the list is updated every t = 20):
Reference time t(now): 20
Request(60)
Request(67)
Request(41)
Request(64)
Request(33)
Request(50)
Request(42)
Request(70)
Request(37)
Request(88)
Request(68)
Request(88)
Request(45)
Cancel(42)
Cancel(64)
Divert(70)

Reference time t(now): 40 (Assuming all requests
before this time has landed)
Print(R)
The application will give the appropriate message for each operation.
